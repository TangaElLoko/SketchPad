# SketchPad || The odin Project

## Exercise description
In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Step One 
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
Use flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research/use CSS Grid for this as Grid will be taught later after the foundations course. This is an opportunity specifically to get more practice in for flexbox!
Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!

## Step two
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
